# Round Robin Software License

a modern open source license that's share-alike for improvements and permissive for apps

This license is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the license's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/berneout/round-robin-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.

## License for the License Text

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this form that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

This license does not allow you to infringe any trademarks.  If you make changes to the form, you must call your changed version by a different name that people will not confuse with the original.

***As far as the law allows, the form comes as is, without any warranty at all, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to the form or its use, for any kind of legal claim.***
