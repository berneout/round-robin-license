# Shared Component License

an open source license that's copyleft for changes, additions, and wrappers, but permissive for applications that just use through the API

This license is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the license's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kemitchell/shared-component-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.
