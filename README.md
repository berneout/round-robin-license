# Round Robin Software License

a modern open source license that's share-alike for improvements and permissive for apps

This license is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the license's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/berneout/round-robin-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.
