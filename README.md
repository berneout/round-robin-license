# Round Robin Software License

an open source license that's copyleft for changes, additions, and wrappers, but permissive for applications and prototypes

This license is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the license's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/berneout/round-robin-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.
