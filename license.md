***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty, and the Developer will not be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, for any kind of legal claim.***

## Acceptance

In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations under our agreement and conditions to your license.  You may not do anything with this software that triggers a rule you cannot or will not follow.

## Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of this software from you, in source code or any other form, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license, including its Developer and Homepage lines.

## Changes

Contribute changes to files containing this software.

## Additions

Contribute additions to this software.  You need not contribute additions to other software that only invokes this software's functionality through the Application Programming Interfaces this software exposes.

## Applications

You need not contribute applications that only invoke this software's functionality through the Application Programming Interfaces this software exposes, unless [Superstructure](#superstructure) requires.

## Superstructure

Contribute software used to make this software's functionality and Application Programming Interfaces available to applications.

## Contribution

When this license requires you to contribute software:

1.  Publish all source code for that software, in the preferred form for making changes, through a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similar source code, so the Developer and others can find and copy it.

2.  License that software under terms with substantially the same legal effect as [Copyright](#patent), [Patent](#patent), and [Reliability](#reliability), so the Developer and others may work with that software, and the Developer may incorporate that software into this software.  Your terms may, but need not, include a rule like [Notices](#notices), a disclaimer like [Disclaimer](#disclaimer), or both, but no other terms.  For example, you may license under the [BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-Patent.html).

## Excuse

You are excused for unknowingly breaking [Notices](#notices), [Changes](#changes), [Additions](#additions), or [Superstructure](#superstructure) if you do what the rule requires, or stop doing anything requiring this license, within 30 days of learning you broke the rule.
