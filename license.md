# Prototypes

The purpose of this exception to [Copyleft](#copyleft) is to allow you to share and license applications of this software as you choose.

# Contributing

When this license requires you to contribute software, take these steps within thirty calendar days of creating or using the software for the first time:

1.  Publish all source code for the software, in the preferred form for making changes, through a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similar source code, so contributors and others can find and copy it.

2.  Ensure that each part of the source code is licensed to the public under one or more of these:

    - The Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0

    - The BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License

    - terms with substantially the same legal effect as [Copyright](#copyright), [Patent](#patent), and [Reliability](#reliability), and optionally a rule like [Notices](#notices), a disclaimer like [No Liability](#no-liability), or both, but no other terms

# No Relicensing

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with [Copyleft](#copyleft), you can keep your license by taking all steps to comply, and responding with the address for the software in the distribution system through which you published, within thirty calendar days after the notice.  If you do not take these steps to comply after a notice, your license ends immediately.
