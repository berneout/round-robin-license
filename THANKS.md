This license would be far worse, if not for great feedback from these people:

- Theo Belaire / [@tbelaire](https://github.com/tbelaire)
- Alexis Richardson / [@monadic](https://github.com/monadic)
- Ben Hilburn / [@bhilburn](https://github.com/bhilburn)
- Luis Villa / [@tieguy](https://github.com/tieguy)

These folks don't necessarily endorse this license.
